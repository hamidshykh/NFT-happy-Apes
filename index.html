                        The Happy Apes are a collection 1,500 Apes ripped straight from the 60s! They have brought their
                        entire personas, cardigans and all. However, they are simply happy, there is no saying that
                        there is nothing more sinister underneath the hood.

                        The team has discussed the actual premise for the game, however, we have not gone in-depth on
                        the mechanics and game itself, it has just been a light overview. In this message, we aim to
                        summarize the game and answer all questions pertaining to it.

                        One may wonder, what has lead these absolutely adorable apes to go savage and rip each other
                        apart? Well it is quite simple, the fateful day that Dr. Albert Hofmann took an accidental trip,
                        something much more sinister happened on Earth ###...

                        Instead of using the substance to explore for new cures to respiratory illnesses, the government
                        had sent Dr. Hofmann to harness its powerful capabilities for new, clean energy that could be
                        generated by the power of the mind. The experiments took place on various primates, however, the
                        primate Pan Paniscus had an extreme reaction. This reaction is what the scientist THOUGHT would
                        lead him to a groundbreaking discover...
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After further experimenting, it became clear the forces they toyed with were beyond their
                        understanding. However, they were carried away foolishly in their attempts to play God. The apes
                        developed powers after this period of experimentation which manifested as dimensional energy
                        reminiscent of a wormhole.

                        This power became too much for anyone to harvest, but the scientists were too deep into their
                        work to stop. Dr. Hofmann had been driven to the brink of madness seemingly by his work, but he
                        was unknowingly being driven mad by the substance that made him the well renound scientist was.

                        Eventually, the apes were able to escape and ventured across points in space and time with their
                        new found powers, leading them to being in the Happy Apes video game!

                        The gameplay will be similar to the popular game "Worms"! Worms is an artillery tactical video
                        game which has small platoons of anthropomorphic characters (worms) battling each other across
                        multiple platform/deformable landscapes. The objective of this game is to eliminate the opposing
                        teams and be a member of the sole surviving team. It is important to note that the worms series
                        featured turn based combat on a 2D battlefield, so the games tend to be strategy-based.

                        <br>
                        The game will have the style of pixel art. However, we will not allow the game to falter in
                        quality! The team will hold ourselves to the standard we did with the NFT art and the game will
                        be just as stunning itself!

                        <br>
                        Yes! Your NFT will be able to offer special rewards like a token multiplier once it has been
                        staked and mutated into an unhinged ape! The 1/1 NFTs will also offer special effects in game
                        like awesome weapons, multipliers, and more!
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        There will be a special mode that allows you to wager a certain amount of $LSD against the
                        opponent and have your apes battle to the death for the prize! The house will take a small cut
                        of a few % off of the total winnings as a tax, however the rest will be rewarded to the victor!
                        This mode will incentivize a skill based wager and we may eventually expand to wagers of other
                        things... (Allow your imagination to run wild!)

                        <br>
                        Although nothing is set in stone, the team hopes that demos can be released within a couple
                        weeks of launch. The team has hired both a developer and an artist, however the only thing that
                        is missing is the funding itself. Our current artist will be making art and teasers as soon as
                        he has the time available so within a couple weeks we will see various posts go out containing
                        said art!

                        The first phase of the Happy Apes roadmap will include the marketing, mint, and secondary
                        listing. The Happy Apes team has acknowledged that these are the barebone essentials of a
                        roadmap, so we will not labor over them as it should already be established our team does the
                        bare minimum. We do not mess around.

                        The team will create a place where verified holders of the Happy Apes NFT can conglomerate and
                        make connections! This will take place shortly after mint and it will allow the community to
                        flourish!

                        In an effort to further build our community in anticipation of the events to come, the team will
                        come together to strengthen the community via a range of events. This could go from simple raids
                        to large scale competitions for prizes!

                    <p>
                        At this time, we will begin the distribution of our token $LSD! Additionally, we will see more
                        demos/updates on the Happy Apes PVP game with a twist! Although it is not stated before, we will
                        have already begun game production long before this and the production will start within days of
                        launch of discord. It is important to mention both of these seemingly foreign concepts together
                        as they will be tied together in terms of utility. Each of these will be funded with large
                        amounts of liquidity.

                        Among the first utilities of $LSD, staking will be performed by sending your Happy Ape to the
                        "Psych Ward". In this staking system, there will be tiers and each one unhinging your ape ever
                        so slightly more.

                        Redeeming a large amount of original Happy Apes NFTs or a lesser number of "mutated" Apes will
                        allow you to have your NFT mutate its traits. These mutations will reward higher yields in
                        staking and token multipliers!

                        PVP game will contain. This game will have utility that ties in the token $LSD and be one of a
                        kind for the SOL ecosystem. The team aims to launch the full game within a month, releasing
                        demos and teasers along the way.
